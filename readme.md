## Description

This webpage is a temporary home for my landing page for my programming portfolio as I progress through curriculum at Epicodus. The requirements are as follows:

> Create a portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS, which will later act as the landing page for your programming portfolio. Do **not** use a template to create your initial HTML and Bootstrap. *Begin your work with an empty page and an initial empty commit*.

> Your CSS stylesheet **must** be named `styles.css` and reside in a `css` directory. Your HTML file page must be called `index.html`. You are not required to use Bootstrap styling in your project but you are welcome to do so - especially if you have enough time for further exploration at the end of the day.

> Your project should include the following:

> Your name.

> An image of you, or something that represents you.

> A list of projects you have created with active links to their GitHub pages sites or GitHub repositories.

> For each, include a brief description of the project and what languages it uses.

> An “About Me” section.

> Your background (education, job experience, or why did you decide to take a class on programming, etc).

> Your current interests, hobbies, and skills.

> A `gh-pages` branch so that your site may be viewed on GitHub Pages at `your-username.github.io/portfolio`.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- Clone repository from GitHub
